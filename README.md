Once I released the whole challenge was about graph traversal I knew there was only two basic ways to solve it

First off a set up a basic cli tool using a nuget package as it base called [FluentCommandLineParser](https://github.com/fclp/fluent-command-line-parser)

Then I setup the basic interfaces and test framework

After that I constructed the graph and graphnode data structures

Then I created the the searching functions and tested for basic performance
